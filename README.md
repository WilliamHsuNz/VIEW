# VIEW_simple_synthetic

These programmes are developed to assess the applicability for the dependent mixture model, otherwise known as hidden Markov model and long short-term memory (LSTM) to forecast quarterly patient TC/HDL measures across a 5 year prediction window.  Time-series synthetic data were generated using the static synthetic VIEW cohort from *Developing a synthetic national population to investigate the impact of different cardiovascular disease risk management strategies: A derivation and validation study*, by Josh Knight et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28384217/).  
R package 'depmix S4' is used for the dependent mixture model.  The transitions of the dependent mixture model are modelled as multinomial logistic model for each state, allowing time-varying covariates to be incorporated into the modelling of the transition matrix.    
LSTM model is built using the Keras API with Tensorflow backend.  The timestep dimension of the input is undefined, allowing input of variable length across the timestep dimension to be used for training.  The model calls the fit_generator() function for training and is passed train_generator() and val_generator() for the training and validation data respectively.
